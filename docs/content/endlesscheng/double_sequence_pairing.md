## 2037. Minimum Number of Moves to Seat Everyone

-   [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-moves-to-seat-everyone/) | [LeetCode CH](https://leetcode.cn/problems/minimum-number-of-moves-to-seat-everyone/) (Easy)

-   Tags: array, greedy, sorting, counting sort
-   Return the minimum number of moves needed to seat everyone.

```python title="2037. Minimum Number of Moves to Seat Everyone - Python Solution"
from typing import List


# Greedy
def minMovesToSeat(seats: List[int], students: List[int]) -> int:
    seats.sort()
    students.sort()
    moves = 0

    for i, j in zip(seats, students):
        moves += abs(i - j)

    return moves


print(minMovesToSeat([3, 1, 5], [2, 7, 4]))  # 4

```

## 455. Assign Cookies

-   [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/assign-cookies/) | [LeetCode CH](https://leetcode.cn/problems/assign-cookies/) (Easy)

-   Tags: array, two pointers, greedy, sorting
-   Return the maximum number of your content children that can be satisfied.

```python title="455. Assign Cookies - Python Solution"
from typing import List


# Greedy
def findContentChildren(g: List[int], s: List[int]) -> int:
    g.sort()
    s.sort()
    i, j = 0, 0

    while i < len(g) and j < len(s):
        if g[i] <= s[j]:
            i += 1
        j += 1

    return i


# |-------------|-------------|--------------|
# |   Approach  |    Time     |    Space     |
# |-------------|-------------|--------------|
# |   Greedy    | O(N * logN) |    O(1)      |
# |-------------|-------------|--------------|


g = [1, 2, 3]
s = [1, 1]
print(findContentChildren(g, s))  # 1

```
