## 733. Flood Fill

-   [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/flood-fill/) | [LeetCode CH](https://leetcode.cn/problems/flood-fill/) (Easy)
-   Tags: array, depth first search, breadth first search, matrix
-   Replace all the pixels of the same color starting from the given pixel.
-   In other words, find the connected component of the starting pixel and change the color of all the pixels in that component.
-   Edge cases: If the starting pixel is already the target color, return the image as it is.
-   **Flood Fill** is essentially a graph traversal algorithm (like BFS or DFS) applied to matrices (2D grids).
    It checks adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) of a starting point to determine whether they belong to the same region.
    Typically, it involves modifying or marking the cells that belong to the same connected component.

## 200. Number of Islands

-   [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/) | [LeetCode CH](https://leetcode.cn/problems/number-of-islands/) (Medium)
-   Tags: array, depth first search, breadth first search, union find, matrix
-   Count the number of islands in a 2D grid.
-   Method 1: DFS
-   Method 2: BFS (use a queue to traverse the grid)

-   How to keep track of visited cells?

    1. Mark the visited cell as `0` (or any other value) to avoid revisiting it.
    2. Use a set to store the visited cells.

-   Steps:
    1. Init: variables
    2. DFS/BFS: starting from the cell with `1`, turn all the connected `1`s to `0`.
    3. Traverse the grid, and if the cell is `1`, increment the count and call DFS/BFS.
