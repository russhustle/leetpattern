## 383. Ransom Note

- Return `True` if the ransom note can be constructed from the magazines, otherwise, return `False`.

```python linenums="1"
--8<-- "0383_ransom_note.py"
```

## 350. Intersection of Two Arrays II

- Return the intersection of two arrays.

```python linenums="1"
--8<-- "0350_intersection_of_two_arrays_ii.py"
```

## 1. Two Sum

- Return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

```python linenums="1"
--8<-- "0001_two_sum.py"
```

```cpp linenums="1"
--8<-- "cpp/0001_two_sum.cpp"
```

## 409. Longest Palindrome

- Return the length of the longest palindrome that can be built with the characters in the string.

```python linenums="1"
--8<-- "0409_longest_palindrome.py"
```

## 1365. How Many Numbers Are Smaller Than the Current Number

- For each number in the array, return how many numbers are smaller than it.

```python linenums="1"
--8<-- "1365_how_many_numbers_are_smaller_than_the_current_number.py"
```

## 202. Happy Number

- Return `True` if the number is a happy number, otherwise, return `False`.
- A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.

```python linenums="1"
--8<-- "0202_happy_number.py"
```

## 454. 4Sum II

- Return the number of tuples `(i, j, k, l)` such that `A[i] + B[j] + C[k] + D[l] == 0`.

```python linenums="1"
--8<-- "0454_4sum_ii.py"
```
