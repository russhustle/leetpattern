## 200. Number of Islands

-   Count the number of islands in a 2D grid.
-   Method 1: DFS
-   Method 2: BFS (use a queue to traverse the grid)

-   How to keep track of visited cells?

    1. Mark the visited cell as `0` (or any other value) to avoid revisiting it.
    2. Use a set to store the visited cells.

-   Steps:
    1. Init: variables
    2. DFS/BFS: starting from the cell with `1`, turn all the connected `1`s to `0`.
    3. Traverse the grid, and if the cell is `1`, increment the count and call DFS/BFS.
