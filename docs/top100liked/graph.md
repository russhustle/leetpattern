## 200. Number of Islands

-   [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/) | [LeetCode CH](https://leetcode.cn/problems/number-of-islands/) (Medium)

-   Tags: array, depth first search, breadth first search, union find, matrix
-   Count the number of islands in a 2D grid.
-   Method 1: DFS
-   Method 2: BFS (use a queue to traverse the grid)

-   How to keep track of visited cells?

    1. Mark the visited cell as `0` (or any other value) to avoid revisiting it.
    2. Use a set to store the visited cells.

-   Steps:
    1. Init: variables
    2. DFS/BFS: starting from the cell with `1`, turn all the connected `1`s to `0`.
    3. Traverse the grid, and if the cell is `1`, increment the count and call DFS/BFS.

## 994. Rotting Oranges

-   [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotting-oranges/) | [LeetCode CH](https://leetcode.cn/problems/rotting-oranges/) (Medium)

-   Tags: array, breadth first search, matrix
-   Return the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange.
-   Hint: Multi-source BFS to count the level.

## 207. Course Schedule

-   [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/) | [LeetCode CH](https://leetcode.cn/problems/course-schedule/) (Medium)

-   Tags: depth first search, breadth first search, graph, topological sort
-   Return true if it is possible to finish all courses, otherwise return false.
-   Dependency relationships imply the topological sort algorithm.
-   Cycle detection
-   Topological Sort
    -   DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)
    -   Time complexity: O(V+E)
    -   Space complexity: O(V+E)
    -   Prerequisites: Indegree (Look at the problem 1557. Minimum Number of Vertices to Reach All Nodes)
        -   Indegree: Number of incoming edges to a vertex
    -   Applications: task scheduling, course scheduling, build systems, dependency resolution, compiler optimization, etc.

### Trie

- A trie is a tree-like data structure whose nodes store the letters of an alphabet.

Root --- C1(("C"))
Root --- D((D))
C1 --- A1(("A"))
A1 --- T1(("T"))
A1 --- R1(("R"))
A1 --- N((N))
Root --- B1((B))
B1 --- A2((A))
A2 --- T2((T))
A2 --- R2((R))
```
